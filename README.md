-To access the main menu go into javafx_pro then go into the folder javafx_webviewyoutube then run the JavaFX.java
-To access Tetris source code enter javafx_pro then go into the folder named tetris and then run TetrisApp.java
-to access the Tetris executable go in javafx_pro and click on TETRIS
-in the JavaFX.java figure out how to execute a either a jar file or tetris package
-buttons are made for playback or quiting/getting score but if they are added to the root pane they impede the tetris game because the arrow keys toggle between them not manipulating the blocks
